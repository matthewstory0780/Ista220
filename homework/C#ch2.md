1. What is a local variable?
---> Variables that exist only in a method or a small section of code.


2. What is a statement?
---> A statement is a command that performs an action such as calculating a value
 and storing the result or displaying a message to a user.


3. What is an identiﬁer?
---> Identifiers are the names that you use to identify the elements in your programs such as:
 namespaces, classes, methods and variables.


4. What is a variable?
---> A variable is a storage location in memory that holds a value.


5. What is a method?
--->A named location in memory that references a behavior.


6. Are primitive types and value types the same thing? See page 177.
---> Most primitive types are collectively called value types, with the exception of string.


7. How are arithmetic operators and variable types related?
---> Variable types interact with arithmetic operators to create new values.


8. How do you turn an integer into a string?
--->The FloatValue method uses the ToString method of the float variable floatvar 
to generate a string version of the value of this variable.


9. How do you turn a string into an integer?
--->$; or Int.Parse will convert string to integer.


10. What is the diﬀerence between precedence and associativity? Give an example where this makes a diﬀerence.
--->Precedence and associativity refer to arithmetic order of operations. 


11. What is the deﬁnite assignment rule?
---> In C# you must assign a value to a variable, otherwise your program will not compile. 



12. How are the preﬁx and postﬁx increment and decrement operators evaluated diﬀerently?
---> They are evaluated the same, the location of the count is what matters.


13. What is string interpoation?
---> The process of evaluating string using place holders.


14. What does the var keyword do?
--->It tells the C# compiler to infer the type the type of variable from an expression an use this type when declaring a variable.
