1. What is the diﬀerence between deep copy and shallow copy?

--Deep copy includes binary, shallow copy is just a reference.

2. What is the value of a reference after you declare and initialize it?

--Whatever the value is initialized to 

3. How do you declare a value type?

--By assigning a data type

4. How do you declare a reference type?

--You create a new instance of the object

5. Does C# allow you to assign NULL to a value type?

--No 

6. Can you assign a nullable value type to a non-nullable variable of the same type? Why or why not?

--No 

7. What is the diﬀerence between the stack and the heap?

--Objects are stored on heap, references are stored on the stack

8. What does it mean when we say that all classes are specialized types?

--?

9. What does ref do?

--causes a method to return the same variable

10. What does out do?

--If you use the keyword "out" then the function must set a value to that variable, i.e. it must output a value

11. Describe boxing and unboxing in your own words.

--Boxing is used to store value types in the garbage-collected heap. Boxing is an implicit conversion of a value type to the type object or to any interface type implemented by this value type. Unboxing is an explicit conversion from the type object to a value type or from an interface type to a value type that implements the interface.

12. What does cast do?12. 

--Cast, in the context of C#, is a method by which a value is converted from one data type to another.
